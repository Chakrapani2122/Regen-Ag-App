## 🚜 What We Do

Our team is dedicated to advancing **regenerative agriculture** — a transformative approach to farming that improves soil, increases resilience, and enhances food systems. Through cutting-edge research, education, and partnerships, we're creating climate-smart, profitable solutions for today’s challenges.

## 🌿 Our Principles

We follow six key principles of regenerative agriculture:
- 🌾 Maximize diversity
- 🚜 Reduce tillage
- 🍀 Keep the soil covered
- 🌱 Maintain living roots
- 🐄 Integrate livestock
- 🌎 Tailor to local ecosystems

These principles help **restore soil health, sequester carbon, and build resilient farms** that thrive with nature, not against it. 🌻

## 🤝 Get Involved

Join us through the **Kansas Soil Health Network (KSHN)**! 🌾  
We're helping farmers adopt proven soil-friendly practices with support from partners like USDA, Kansas Corn Commission, and The Nature Conservancy.

- 🔬 On-farm trials & research
- 🌱 Demonstration farms
- 💰 Market opportunities for nutrient-rich crops

**Together, let’s grow a more regenerative future. 🌾💚**
